### Hi there, I'm Xos ðŸ‘‹

Every place is a source of knowledge and I'm made from all the moments I've lived, my past in Psychology, my present in entrepreneurship, and of course my always active commitment with social justice. Every step led me to the tech industry with a unique perspective and wide variety of skills.

I'm eager to collaborate with passionate people and explore the endless possibilities of development designed for everyone.
